            <h1>Collage</h1>
            <p>As a project in my graphic design class, SI 320, I was tasked with creating a collage of floral imagery and typography.
                the goal was to find a floral illustration, study the meaning of the flower chosen, pick a word that I felt represented
                the flower and my personal expression well, and then work with layers in photoshop to nestle each letter into the foliage
                of the floral illustration.
            </p>
            <h2>Design</h2>
            <p>I have always loved lavender - its scent, its subtle feminine power, and its color. The lavender I chose was a slight variation
                on the most common type of lavender, called spanish lavender, which did not feature the light shade of purple I was expecting,
                but made for a beautiful and earthy color scheme. I opted for a split complementary color harmony with two shades of green, two 
                shades of yellow-tan, and white. I wanted to emphasize the earthy tones of this color scheme and made the background a deep tan,
                and made the lettering yellow with a black border. I decided to let the greens shine through the floral illustration alone.
            </p>

            <h2>Implementation</h2>
            <p>I used photoshop on desktop to isolate the background of the floral illustration and remove it. I then moved to photoshop on iPad
                to fix the edges of each and every leaf so that I could change the color of the background to the deep tan I was imagining. It was
                by far the most detailed edge isolation I have ever completed, but well worth it. I then utilized the layer features on photoshop
                to nestle each letter within the leaves of the floral image in a cohesive way.
            </p>

            <h2>Feedback & Edits</h2>
            <p>A large part of my course is recieving feedback from instructors and peers to improve work for the future. The most valuable Feedback
                I recieved was to consider making the text larger so that it is more of a focus of the collage, rather than being deeply intertwined
                with the leaves. This is a project I intend to come back to in the future to make the image and letters more balanced!
