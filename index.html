            <img src="img/myface.jpg" alt="Emma Brown Headshot" class="headshot" width="500" height="600">
            <p>I’m a junior at the University of Michigan’s School of Information studying UX Design and Computer Science.  </p>
            <h2>My Mission</h2>
                <div class="mission">
                    <div class= "mission_items">
                        <h3>Education</h3>
                        <p>All students, regardless of location, race, identity, socio-economic status, or ability, deserve an equitable education.
                            Now more than ever, technology is an essential part of a well-rounded education, yet many students are left without. I
                            am committed to making technology more accessible to students, and developing technology that makes online learning effective.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Mentorship</h3>
                        <p>I am a firm believer in the importance of personal relationships and connection in all industries. I aim to provide emotional, 
                            professional, and academic support to the coworkers and/or students I work with.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Social Good</h3>
                        <p>I want to make and use technology that contributes positively to the health and well-being of its users. Technology has 
                            incredible potential to help those who need it most, and I want to harness that potential to work directly with and for
                            people to create a sustainable world we are proud to live in.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Strategy</h3>
