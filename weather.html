            <h1>Weather App Redesign</h1>
            <p>As a project in my graphic design class, SI 320, I was tasked with creating a minimalistic, geometric deisgn for a weather app.
                I designed six screens with six different weather conditions at various times of day - morning, middday, afternoon, and night.
                I completed this design using Figma, and focused on devloping skills in color selection and composition using Gestalt principles.
            </p>
            <h2>Design</h2>
            <p>I experimented with color and compositon to create geometric designs that also had a bright and whimsical feel. My intention was to include large,
                 solid, colorful shapes that were slightly cartoon-ish, but effectively expressed the time of day and weather state. I wanted the weather conditions 
                 with precipitation to be dynamic and random, and I wanted to include continuity in each screen.
            </p>

            <img class="weather_colors" src="img/color_weather1.jpeg" alt="color scheme 1">
            <img class="weather_colors" src="img/color_weather2.jpeg" alt="color scheme 2">

            <img class="weather_sketch" src="img/sketch_color.png" alt="sketch with color">
            </div>
            <h2>Implementation</h2>
            <p>I used Figma to design these screens. I began with the most simple screen, which was sunny weather, first, and worked from there. As I familiarized myself with this
                 workspace, I discovered a lot of useful features, and noticed where Figma was lacking in comparison to Illustrator.

            </div>
            <h2>Feedback & Edits</h2>
            <p>In class, I recieved feedback from my instructors and peers about how I could improve my project. The most valuable feedback I recieved was to think
                more about what design features I could turn into patterns and use in more of the screens to create a more cohesive design. I took that advice and
                included more clouds, rounded rectangles, and generally organic shapes to tie my designs together into one weather app.
